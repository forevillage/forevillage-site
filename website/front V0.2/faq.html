    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <p>
      Here are answers to common questions about our websites and how
      the process works.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="intro faq">
    <h3>Why do I need a website?</h3>
	<p>
	  A website gives your business a professional home online that you fully control.
	  It helps customers find you, learn about your services, and trust your business
	  before they contact you.
	</p>	
    <h3>What do I get when I order a website?</h3>
    <p>
      You get a clean, professional website customized with your business
      name, content, and contact information — ready to go live.
    </p>

    <h3>Do I need my own domain?</h3>
    <p>
      No. Your website can go live immediately on a
      <strong>yourbusiness.forevillage.com</strong> subdomain.
      Of course, you can move to your own domain anytime.
    </p>

    <h3>How long does it take?</h3>
    <p>
      Most websites are ready within a few days after we receive your
      content and details.
    </p>

    <h3>Can I make changes later?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. We can help update your website, or provide the files if you
      prefer to manage it yourself.
    </p>

    <h3>Is this a monthly subscription?</h3>
    <p>
      No. Pricing is simple and transparent. No hidden monthly fees.
    </p>

    <h3>What kind of businesses is this for?</h3>
    <p>
      Our websites are designed for small businesses such as restaurants,
      cafés, salons, studios, consultants, and local service providers.
